# SimpleCQRS

This is a simple adaptation of Greg Young's [SimpleCQRS](https://github.com/gregoryyoung/m-r "SimpleCQRS repository on Gregg Youngs github page.").

In this adaptation the solution is restructured to match the [Onion Architecture](https://jeffreypalermo.com/2008/07/the-onion-architecture-part-1/ "Onion Architecture by Jeffrey Palermo") as described by Jeffrey Palermo.

The FakeBus is replaced by [MediatR](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR/ "GitHub repository of MediatR") from Jimmy Bogard.
